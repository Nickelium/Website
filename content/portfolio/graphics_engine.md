This is a simple a realtime software renderer that emulates the OpenGL graphics pipeline. 
It utilizes few dependencies and is built mostly from scratch and written in C++98/C++11. 
The goal of this project is to build a renderer without the help of any Graphics API such as DirectX, OpenGL or Vulkan. 
Therefore it doesn't utilize any hardware acceleration provided by the GPU.
