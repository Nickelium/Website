Hi! I'm <i>Tri Tran</i> an upcoming college graduate from <i>Howest, Belgium</i> right now living in <i>Brussels, Belgium</i>. 
Currently I'm looking for an <b>internship</b> for the period starting at February 2020 to June 2020.

Previously I graduated from <i>KULeuven, Belgium</i> in June 2017 with a Bachelor of Science in Informatics.
Near the period of graduation, my interest shifted from general Computer Science to Game Development in a general context. 
Therefore, I pursued my education at University College Howest, Belgium.
Along the way I found the intersection, which I was looking for, Graphics Programming.

Over the years I've tackled a variety of fields and technologies. 
This goes from abstract Mathematics, Engineering, Computer Science, APIs/Frameworks, Game Engines and to Arts and Design ...

My main interest and current focus lies in Game Programmming but more specifically Engine and Rendering.
On a day to day basis I try to utilize C/C++ in a more effective way (no pun intended) and keeping myself up-to-date to the new Rendering techniques.
Those are not restricted to some specific Graphics API but also applies to Offline Rendering and more, 
which you can see more on this <i><a href="/portfolio"> page</a></i>.
Once in awhile I like to study some mathematics accompanied with a bottle water of exactly 2L ;)

Whenever I'm not working on some projects or programming, chances are than you'll find me in a swimming pool, 
which I have been practicing over more than a decade already!
Still haven't found me? Then you might want to check the gym. 
Once in a while I boot up my console to play some fighting game, which I'm still terrible at it.

If you're interested, you can find my resume [here].
