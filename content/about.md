Hi! I'm <i>Tri Tran</i> an upcoming college graduate from <i>Howest, Belgium</i>, right now living in <i>Brussels, Belgium</i>. 
Currently I'm looking for an <b>internship</b> for the period starting at February 2020 to June 2020.

Previously I studied and graduated from <i>KULeuven, Belgium</i> in June 2017 with a Bachelor of Science in Informatics. Near the graduation period,
my interest shifted from general Computer Science to Game development. Instead of continuing with a master in Computer Science,
I decided to start to discover the world of Game development, more precisely Graphics Programming. 
That's how I landed at the University College Howest, Belgium.

During my studies I have deepened my knowledge in multiple fields such as abstract Mathematics, Engineering, Software development,
 APIs/Framework, Game Engines. 
Besides these technical fields, I have also worked on Digital Arts and Design.

My main interest and current focus lie in Game Programming but more specifically Engine- and Rendering Programming.
On a day to day basis I try to utilize C/C++ in a more effective way (no pun intended) and keeping myself up-to-date to the new Rendering techniques.
Those are not restricted to some specific Graphics API but also applies for example to Offline Rendering, 
which you can see more on this <i><a href="/portfolio"> page</a></i>.

Whenever I'm not working on some projects or programming, chances are than you'll find me in a swimming pool, 
which I have been practicing over a decade already!
Still haven't found me? Then you might want to check the gym. 
Once in a while I boot up my console to play some fighting game, which I'm still terrible at it.

If you're interested, you can find my resume <a href="files/resume.pdf"><b>[here]<b/></a>.
