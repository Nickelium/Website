Hello World ! Welcome to my personal website/portfolio page. 

This site serves as a place to show my personal projects and also to share some of my thoughts in the form of a blog post.

Most of the content that are about to come will be presumably related to Programming (C/C++, ...) 
and Rendering (Rasterization, Raytracing, ...). 



This is the very first post on this website and is intended to verify it's full functionality and correctness.
